Video Summarizer 

This task is to generate a Json file of video summary using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 

Here I used text-davinci-003 model to produce higher-quality writing -also this model handle complex instructions and generate longer-form content.

## Steps to recreate the generation.

Install required dependencies using requirement.txt file.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
